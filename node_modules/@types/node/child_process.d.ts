/**
 * The `child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in
 * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
 * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { spawn } = require('child_process');
 * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
 *
 * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.on('close', (code) => {
 *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
 * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
 * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
 * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
 * subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
 * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }`option if the output will not be consumed.
 *
 * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
 * variable if it is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
 * used.
 *
 * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
 * lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that
 * case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be
 * passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing
 * objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as`PATH` and `Path`.
 *
 * The {@link spawn} method spawns the child process asynchronously,
 * without blocking the Node.js event loop. The {@link spawnSync} function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks
 * the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.
 *
 * For convenience, the `child_process` module provides a handful of synchronous
 * and asynchronous alternatives to {@link spawn} and {@link spawnSync}. Each of these alternatives are implemented on
 * top of {@link spawn} or {@link spawnSync}.
 *
 * * {@link exec}: spawns a shell and runs a command within that
 * shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when
 * complete.
 * * {@link execFile}: similar to {@link exec} except
 * that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by
 * default.
 * * {@link fork}: spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a
 * specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows
 * sending messages between parent and child.
 * * {@link execSync}: a synchronous version of {@link exec} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 * * {@link execFileSync}: a synchronous version of {@link execFile} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 *
 * For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the `synchronous counterparts` may be more convenient. In many cases, however,
 * the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to
 * stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.
